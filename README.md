Liferay Audience Targeting Extensions Workspace</h1>

This repository represents a template workspace for building extensions for the Liferay Audience Targeting application using OSGi.
The workspace contents are based off of the [OSGi enRoute workspace][1] which uses gradle to drive the headless build and Liferay IDE+bndtools (Eclipse plugin) for IDE integration.
If you want to get started with building extensions for Audience Targeting application, then follow the steps in the [quick-start guide][2].
